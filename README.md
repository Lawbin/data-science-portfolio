# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting US Census Income](https://github.com/Lawbin/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/US%20Census%20Income/ML%20-%20Census%20Income.ipynb):  A model to predict whether an individual makes more than or less than $50k annually. This prediction was based on demographic, education, marital status, working class, and occupation.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- __Python__
		- [Indeed Webscrape & Analysis](https://github.com/Lawbin/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Indeed%20Webscrape): Analysis of data scientist jobs available in California, USA from webscraping Indeed.
		
	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib_

- ### Projects: 

	- __Python__
		- [Movie Recommendations using Hybrid Recommender Systems](https://github.com/Lawbin/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Movie%20Recommender/Group%20projects%203.ipynb): A project to build a hybrid recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on movies the user has liked in the past and similarities amongst other users. To further enhance this project, the recommendation system was incorporated through a chatbot
		
		- [Fashion AI-Recommender](https://github.com/Lawbin/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Fashion%20Recommender/Model%20for%20fashion-combined.ipynb): A capstone project (an assignment acting as an academic and intellectual experience) to build a fashion recommender that allows users to upload an image with clothing they wish to purchase onto the site. Next, the machine learning based recommender classifies the image based on clothing attributes. Finally, the recommender directs users to relevant famous shopping websites.
